// GET /api/attendance-open?date=YYYY-MM-DD
// Returns the signed-in user's open (no time_out) attendance record for
// that date, or { record: null } if there isn't one.
//
// This exists specifically for the mobile app's background geofencing
// task: that task runs outside the React tree (no access to the already-
// loaded `db` state from data/store.js) and needs to check "do I have an
// open session to close?" as cheaply as possible -- pulling the entire
// database via GET /api/db just to answer that one question would be slow
// and wasteful to run from a background task. `date` is passed by the
// client (computed the same way the rest of the app computes "today",
// i.e. local to the phone) rather than guessed server-side, since the
// server's own clock/timezone has no reason to match the phone's.
